# TR-PDF-Parser
Parses invoice PDF files from the german brokerage Trade Republic

# The problem
To keep track of my investing activities, I manually read the latest invoices and extracted the properties from the latest trades. After a while, I made some mistakes and archived the files with a wrong name convention. That's when I decided to write a script.

This python script checks a specified folder for invoices, parses them and moves them to an archive folder.

# Installation
- clone the git repo
- specify the source and destination folders in main.py
- start the script!
